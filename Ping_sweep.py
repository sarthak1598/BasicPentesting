# This is another handy script i used to make while learning the pentesting with python for unix/linux.
# This code actually ping the whole network or subnet defined by the user.

# Works as directed by the network id entered by the user 

# New modules used 
#ipaddress 

import subprocess # to handle the unix system commands
import ipaddress  # for digging into the network 

network_address = input("Enter the network address in CIDR FORMAT")
format(EX.192.168.1.0/24): ")

# getting into the network 
ipnetwork = ipaddress.ip_networ(network_address)

hostlists = list(ipnetwork.hosts())


# pinging the complete subnet with all of his hosts 

for i in range(len(hostslist)):
    output = subprocess.Popen(['ping','-n','1','-w', '500', str(hostslist[i])] , stdout=subprocess.PIPE, startupinfo=info).communicate()[0]
    
    if "Destination host unreachable" in output.decode('utf-8'):
